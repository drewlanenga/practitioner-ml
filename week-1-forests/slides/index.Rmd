## Linear Statistical Models

Predicting output from well-defined input


`Y ~ B1*X1 + B2*X2 + ... + BM*XM + e`

```
Y = BX   --(linear algebra)-->   B = (XtX)^-1 * XtY
```

```
Y   = Vector (n) of values to predict
X   = Matrix (m x n) of useful data
B   = Vector (m) of coefficients
```

* Can be computationally expensive -- matrix inversion is hard
* Can be numerically unstable -- `XtX` needs to be full rank to invert
* Implies a global model


Let's do an example with Fisher's Iris data

---

```{r}
data(iris)
pairs(iris)
```

---

```{r}
data(iris)
model <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width + Petal.Length + as.factor(Species), data = iris)
print(summary(model)$coefficients)
```

## Regression Trees

* Idea is the same
    - For given set of data `X`, predict an outcome `Y`
* Methodology is different
    - Recursively partition data, then fit simple localized models to the partition.

## Scalability

* Least Squares problems don't scale well -- difficulty of inverting `XtX` increases exponentially
* Regression trees work better, but still fitting one tree to a giant dataset can be intensive


In both cases, you can use an [ensemble](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning)-based approach (wisdom in the masses)
* Ensembles in least squares is called [bagging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_aggregating)
* Ensembles in regression trees are called random forests

## Random Forests in Action

We'll grow a random forest to predict the probability that a user will return to a stream (in the next 30 days)

### Hypothesis
The best users have a predictable (regular) usage pattern for most streams.
